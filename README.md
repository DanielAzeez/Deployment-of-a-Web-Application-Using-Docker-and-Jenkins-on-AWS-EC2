# Deployment-of-a-Web-Application-Using-Docker-and-Jenkins-on-AWS-EC2
This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a simple Node.js to-do application using Docker, Jenkins, and AWS EC2. The to-do app is built and containerized with Docker, and Jenkins is used to set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy the application to an EC2 instance.
